  def install
    # We can't use `make install` here.  `get_script_dir` in neofetch returns
    # script dir, which ends with `/bin` in Linuxbrew.  This makes neofetch
    # unable to access resources.
    #
    # We install neofetch as its git repository layout.

    # But we still install manpage into `share/man`, because Homebrew/Linuxbrew
    # finds manual pages in `share/man/...`, and not in `man/...`.  See [1].
